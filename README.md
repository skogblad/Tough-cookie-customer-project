# CSS Customer Project
## About

As a part of one of my first assignment during my front end education at [Medieinstitutet](https://github.com/medieinstitutet) we were giving a brief with instructions and a ready design to create for a website. The focus for this project was to learn and work with CSS. The website is one-pager.
